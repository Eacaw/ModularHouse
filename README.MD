# Modular house building pack

## About

Modular low poly house building pack for Unity. All files are in FBX format, have basic textures on them and are ready to be used in Unity. Each should have an origin point at one of the corners of the wall, so that they can be easily placed together.

> **_NOTE:_** These are not perfectly aligned and some overlap may be required to make a seamless house. The pillars are there to use to help cover up alignment issues. This is not a professional quality pack, but it is free for all uses.
